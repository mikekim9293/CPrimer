#include <iostream>

// Exercise 2.36
/* int a = 3, b = 4;
 * decltype(a) c = a;
 * decltype((b)) d = a;
 * ++c;
 * ++d;
 * c is int, d is int& referring to a.
 * c has a value of 4.
 * d has a value of 4, as well as a, because d is int&.
 * b has a value of 4.
 */

// Exercise 2.37
/* int a = 3, b = 4;
 * decltype(a) c = a;
 * decltype(a = b) d = a;
 * c is int, d is int& referring to a.
 * a, c, d have value of 3. b has value of 4.
 */

// Exercise 2.38
/* auto deduces type from initializer. decltype deduces type from variable or
 * expression. decltype handles top-level const and references subtly from the
 * way auto does. decltype depends on the form of its given expression.
