// Exercise 2.1
/* Differences between int, long, long long, and short integer types are the
 / different minimum sizes (bits) defined by a standard. For must uses int and
 / long long are sufficient for integer arithmetic. Unsigned and signed types
 / specify the range and type of values the type can store. Unsigned types are
 / generally restricted to positive integers including 0. Signed types can have
 / both negative and positive values including 0 and their range is usually
 / evenly divided between positive and negative values.
*/

// Exercise 2.2
/* To calculate a mortgage payment, the following values should be used for
 / rate, principal, and payment.
 / rate - double
 / principal - double
 / payment - double
 / All values should be type double because floating-point computations are 
 / necessary. Integer types would not be appropriate. Doubles are preferred over
 / float because doubles are usually faster and they will have enough precision.
