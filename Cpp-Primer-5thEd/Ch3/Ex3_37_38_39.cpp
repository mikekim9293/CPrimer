// Exercise 3.37
/* Program prints characters in array, each on a new line. However it would not 
 * terminate as expected. As the array is not null character terminated, the 
 * while loop will not terminate until a null character is reached in memory
 * following the array.
 */

// Exercise 3.38
/* Adding two pointers is meaningless because they do not point to the same
 * object. The result of adding the two pointers may not point to any particular
 * object. It would simply signify an address in memory that represent the
 * result of adding the two pointers. Something actually useful may be the 
 * different of two pointers, which would give you the distance between the two
 * pointers.
