// Exercise 4.14
/* if (42 = i)
 * if (i = 42)
 * In first assignment, it is illegal. Left operand of assignment must be lvalue
 * but a literal is rvalue.
 * In second assignment, 42 is assigned to i. The result of that assignment is
 * used in the condition. This will evaluate to true because value of i is 
 * nonzero.
