/* Yes. In my opinion and my current knowledge of how this affects my ability to
 * program C++, I think this is an acceptable trade-off between efficient code
 * generation and potential pitfalls in the use of the language by the
 * programmer. As long as there is a standard that dictates the precedence and
 * associativity and there is a way to force certain groupings, I currently
 * can't think of a scenario where this trade-off would hurt or inconvenience me
 * while writing a C++ program.
