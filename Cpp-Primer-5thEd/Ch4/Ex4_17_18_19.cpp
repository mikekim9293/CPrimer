// Exercise 4.17
/* The difference between prefix and postfix increment is what they return as a
 * result of execution. In the prefix increment, the incremented object is 
 * returned as a result. In the postfix increment, the original value of the
 * object is stored and returned as a result and the object is incremented.
 */

// Exercise 4.18
/* If the while loop on page 148 in the text used the prefix increment operator,
 * the first element of the vector will be skipped and will go one element too
 * far in the last iteration! The last iteration, dereferencing of pbeg will be
 * undefined behavior.
 */

// Exercise 4.19
/* ptr points to int, vec is vector<int>, ival is int
 * (a) ptr != 0 && *ptr++
 * If ptr is not null pointer, check pointer value.
 * (b) ival++ && ival
 * Copy current value of ival and increment it. If current value is nonzero,
 * compare agains incremented ival and check if its nonzero.
 * (c) vec[ival++] <= vec[ival]
 * This is uncorrect because it is not specified which operand is evaluated
 * first for the <= relational operator. Depending on which operand is
 * evaluated first, the behavior may be different. This is correct and what the
 * programmer probably intended:
 * vec[ival] <= vec[ival + 1]
