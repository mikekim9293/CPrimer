// Exercise 2.19
/* The key difference between a pointer and a reference is how they indirectly
 * access an object. A reference is simply another name for an already existing
 * object. Reference can't be changed after its definition. A reference must be
 * initialized at definition. A pointer holds the address of the object to which
 * it points to. It can point to many different object over its lifetime. A
 * pointer is an object in its own right, unlike a reference. A pointer does not
 * have to be initialized at definition.
 */

// Exercise 2.20
/* The pointer p1 assigns a new value to the object to which it points. The new
 * value is squared the original value (i.e. new value is 42*42).
 */

// Exercise 2.21
/* int i = 0;
 * (a) double* dp = &i;
 * Illegal. Types do not match.
 * (b) int *ip = i;
 * Illegal. Can't initialize pointer to variable even if value is 0.
 * (c) int *ip = &i;
 * Legal.
